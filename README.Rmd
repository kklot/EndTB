The goal of EndTB is to provide a convinient set of established TB models for
simulation, estimation, and projection of Tuberculosis Epidemic.

## Installation

You can install the development version of EndTB like so:

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github('kklot/EndTB')
```

Documents of the package and functions can be view as normal R's documentation
or online at [EndTB.de.](https://endtb.kklot.github.io)

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to start a model:

```{r}
library(EndTB)
TB <- TBM$new(c(sigma = 2))
```

Steady-state of the model without treatments and no population growth.

```{r plot}
TB$plot()
```

Check out model's parameters and states for Moldova model.

```{r para}
EndTB:::states_moldova
EndTB:::pars_moldova
```

## TODO

- [ ] Revise main (and currently the only) model
- [ ] Add fitting example
- [ ] Add model variations
